# Introduction #

Our app, Game Source, presents a list of games by a category type. Once a game type has been selected you will discover new games or rediscover games that you know and love. The website will list games and provide a brief desciription and some of the general rules for the game. If you have spotted something that seems incorrect or have a game in mind that you would like to add, we do have an Update and Create Another Game button. These buttons will lead you to a form where you can make changes. Finally, we have also included the option to delete a game should you feel that the information is totally incorrect and would like to start over.
